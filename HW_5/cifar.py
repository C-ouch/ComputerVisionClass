# For this assignment, you will train a performant CNN-based classifier on CIFAR-10 by performing a grid search over two variables that impact network performance. Some examples of variables you can play with are:

# Learning Rate
# Batch Size
# Optimizer
# Number of network layers
# Number of convolutional kernals
# Network structure (adding more dropout layers, adding batch normalization, etc.)
# Data augmentation (cropping, standardization, etc.)
